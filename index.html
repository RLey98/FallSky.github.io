          <p>
            Welcome to “Fall Sky”, a platform video game set in an ordinary
            world as we know it, when without warning an alien fleet descends
            from the sky ready to invade us. In this game, we will assume the
            role of a young man named “Scott” who has to survive the attacks,
            missiles, projectiles of the fleet, where “Scott’s” main objective
            is………..SURVIVE!
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of this video game is to be a short game which you can
            play anytime and anywhere, and also that the times to be able to
            play would not be a problem since one could restart the game without
            any complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, it encourages self-improvement since with Infinite mode
            the player can break their own survival record as many times and as
            far as he can.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three impacts/sightings of alien fleets have been recorded on planet
            Earth. First impact: Year -3997,985 BC. (Strong suspicions, cannot
            be confirmed yet) Second impact: September 13, 2000 AD. Third
            impact: December 31, 2015 AD. (Present) It is the morning of
            December 31, 2015, the alien fleet has arrived on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scott is a 17 year old young man, who at the time of the third
            impact was at home, He goes out to see what is happening and
            observes how the fleet is above him, and notices it as a strange
            object. Resembling a gun he falls from the ships and he grabs it.
            The aliens realize that Paul has the weapon and launch their attacks
            towards him. Scott will now have to survive for a few minutes until
            the weapon fully charged to fire at the fleet and eliminate it once
            and for all. Will he be able to do it?
